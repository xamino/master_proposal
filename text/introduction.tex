\chapter{Introduction}

The author proposes the implementation of a peer to peer file synchronization tool via the Toxcore protocol.
The goal is a secure, decentralized method of keeping files between computers synchronized without having to rely on trusted third parties.

\section{General Features}

%TODO rewrite
First and foremost all communication between clients must be fully encrypted.
The system should be internet agnostic.
This is to mean that while the synchronization can be run via the internet, it should also work on a LAN without external internet access.
Ideally this would allow file synchronization completely off line by using mobile devices as data bridges.

TODO: introduce and explain required features of Tox and why they fulfill the general features

TODO: shouldn't this maybe be in existing work?
