\section{Introduction}

The author proposes the implementation of a peer to peer file synchronization tool over the Toxcore protocol.
The goal is a secure, decentralized method of keeping files between computers synchronized without having to rely on trusted third parties.
The proposed thesis would outline the conceptual work required to design and implement a software suite that fulfills these basic goals.

\section{Motivation}

NOTE: THIS IS ALL VERY MUCH STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL BE DRASTICALLY REFINED OVER THE NEXT 2 WEEKS!

% Problem

% this paragraph might have to go, it is overly presumptuous
The thesis is mainly motivated by the revelations of drag net surveillance by Edward Snowden.
The lack of public discussion on the future of privacy on the internet in light of these revelations has shown that internet users are not able to see the implications of their revocation of basic privacy rights.
Thus new software solutions are required to enable users to take back their privacy on the internet.
However a large problem for this undertaking is that many users are comfortable with the existing services which enable the surveillance or at least do not pose a significant hindrance to them.

% tox / whispersystems argument: we require trivially easy to use software that is in its core absolutely secure
Solutions to enforcing privacy on the internet have existed for quite a while already.
However many of these are deemed cumbersome by the normal user and thus avoided whenever possible.

% move the motivation over to enabling privacy of data
This proposed thesis is to tackle the problem of cloud data storage, often used for distributed file access across multiple computers.
Existing solutions mainly rely on specific servers on the internet that offer storage space.
Access is granted over the server's owners via proprietary closed source software.
% the above requires reworking
While the data transfered is now encrypted in transit in most cases, it is not encrypted while residing on the servers.
This allows anyone with access to the server to fully access the data, so long as it was not already previously encrypted by the user.
Before Snowden the third parties were entrusted with the safe keeping of the stored data under the presumption that no unauthorized access was allowed or even possible.
However this trust has been lost now that the public has been made aware of the possibilities of state organizations to access any data without due legal process.
% maybe expand a bit on the trust things? --> why do we require a trusted 3rd party? what benefit does it give the user?

%TODO an expansion on why security and privacy generally matter might be of importance too

% Importance of Topic
The proposed software is a further step into a fully decentralized and secure internet application environment which would harden users' privacy.

\section{Old}

First and foremost all communication between clients must be fully encrypted.
The system should be internet agnostic.
This is to mean that while the synchronization can be run via the internet, it should also work on a LAN without external internet access.
Ideally this would allow file synchronization completely off line by using mobile devices as data bridges.

TODO: introduce and explain required features of Tox and why they fulfill the general features

TODO: shouldnâ€™t this maybe be in existing work?
