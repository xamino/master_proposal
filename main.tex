\section{Introduction}

The author proposes the implementation of a peer to peer file synchronization tool over the Toxcore protocol.
The goal is a secure, decentralized method of keeping files between computers synchronized without having to rely on trusted third parties.
The proposed thesis would outline the conceptual work required to design and implement a software suite that fulfills these basic goals.
This includes the specification of a protocol to facilitate the necessary communication over the data channels.

\section{Motivation}

NOTE: THIS IS ALL VERY MUCH STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL BE DRASTICALLY REFINED OVER THE NEXT 2 WEEKS!

% Problem

% this paragraph might have to go, it is overly presumptuous
The thesis is mainly motivated by the revelations of drag net surveillance by Edward Snowden and the compliance by so called trusted service providers.
Thus new software solutions are required to enable users to take back their privacy on the internet without sacrificing usability and ease of access.

A range of software has come into the spotlight of public disclosure since the revelations that already work towards this goal.
One example is the Open Whisper Systems group.
Their stated goal on the website is "[...] we're working to advance the state of the art for secure communication, while simultaneously making it easy for everyone to use."~\cite{web:site:whispersystems:about}.
Another example is the Tox instant messenger community that is building a free, open source, peer to peer Skype alternative~\cite{web:site:tox}.

% move the motivation over to enabling privacy of data
The proposed thesis is to tackle the problem of cloud data storage, often used for distributed file access across multiple computers.
Existing examples of this include Google Drive~\cite{web:site:gdrive} and Dropbox~\cite{web:site:dropbox}.
While the data transfered is now encrypted in transit in most cases, it is not encrypted while residing on the servers.
This allows anyone with access to the server to fully access the data, so long as it was not already previously encrypted by the user.
Before Snowden the third parties were entrusted with the safe keeping of the stored data under the presumption that no unauthorized access was allowed or even possible.
However this trust has been lost now that the public has been made aware of the possibilities of state organizations to access any data without due legal process.
% maybe expand a bit on the trust things? --> why do we require a trusted 3rd party? what benefit does it give the user?

%TODO an expansion on why security and privacy generally matter might be of importance too

% Importance of Topic
The proposed software is a further step into a fully decentralized and secure internet application environment which would harden users' privacy.

\section{Old}

First and foremost all communication between clients must be fully encrypted.
The system should be internet agnostic.
This is to mean that while the synchronization can be run via the internet, it should also work on a LAN without external internet access.
Ideally this would allow file synchronization completely off line by using mobile devices as data bridges.

TODO: introduce and explain required features of Tox and why they fulfill the general features

TODO: shouldnâ€™t this maybe be in existing work?
